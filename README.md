# spotify2yt2mp3
This is a small tool for everyone who dont want to lose they curated Playlists after leaving Spotify and dont want to pay for YT Premium. 

What does this tool do ?

Basically just taking your Spoti Plalists and searches YT for the same metadata and in the end downloads the mp3 if it finds a match.
